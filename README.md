# Botnet Detection with Machine Learning

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Abstract

Malware and other phishing attempts are becoming more widely spread than ever before in the world today. People today continue to move more and more of their daily routines, memories, and transactions over to digital devices. The issue here lies with the amount of sensitive data people move over to their digital devices. This sensitive data gives hackers incentive and leaves people prone to attacks from black hat hackers attempting to gain and wrongfully use that data. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of botnets to obtain this sensitive data. A Botnet by definition is a network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge These attacks implemented using botnet makes botnets a very dangerous threat to anyone using a device today. Previously completed research shows much difficulty in predicting malicious botnets. This ever-growing need for a solution to the rapidly increasing number of botnets on the internet today still remains up in the air. What makes this problem even more difficult is that not all botnets are technically malicious. Botnets are used by corporations every day to help solve costumer service related issues, help users buy products, and much more. Using machine learning, the goal is to properly identify a botnet on a website using key features that all botnets abide by. Once able to properly detect a botnet, many doors will open up in the world of cybersecurity that allow internet websites to manage this ongoing problem.
